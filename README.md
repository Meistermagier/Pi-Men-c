# Pi-Men-c

This is a repository with Notebooks that i have created over the Course of a Small Project @ Landesternwarte Heidelberg where i used different methods to recover the Known Transit of the Exoplanet Pi Mensae c with the Help of the TESS Lightcurves. Im uploading this here in hopes that people that want to learn more about how to find these Transit Curves have a simple starting point that starts of with the Little Knowledge i had at the beginning of my Project.
